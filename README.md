#### Election-Audit Summary
After completing this audit, the election commision could use this script as a tool to find additional data they may need for other elections they hold, with modifications to fit their needs. First, additional variables could be added to fit the needs of that particular election for example, if the audit required more voter information you could use voter demographics, voter age, and voter county location. Second, if the election commision wanted to present data for the number of votes and the winning candidate for specfic voting booths within the county, the script can be modified to show that.
